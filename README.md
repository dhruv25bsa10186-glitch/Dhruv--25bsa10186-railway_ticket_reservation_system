My name is dhruv.
This project is a command-line Train Ticket Management System that simulates how ticket booking, account management, and verification could work in a simplified railway system.
The application basically supports three user roles:

 1. Admin
Create new locations
Define train routes
Modify or delete routes
Maintain system-level data

2. Customer
Create an account
Login & book tickets
Generate QR-based ticket with PNR
View past booking history

3. Ticket Checker (TC)
Login
Verify tickets using PNR
Validate QR-generated ticket details
